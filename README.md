# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

https://article-preview-challenge-git-main.nonowelle.vercel.app/

## The challenge

This was my third Front-End Mentor challenge. I had to build out an article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only JavaScript I needed for this challenge was to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

The users had to be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
